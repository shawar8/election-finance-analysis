Exploring Financial Contributions of U.S Presidential Elections

This project involves applying exploration data analysis techniques on the financial contributions received by the 2016 U.S presidential candidates in the major swing state of Florida using R. The process involves going through the data, removing unwanted data, handling outliers followed by the analysis.

I tackle this project in a step by step manner, first looking at univariate relationships, followed by bivariate relationships and finally, multivariate relationships. 
I look at various contributions based on contributor occupation, locations, time of the year, etc. My final plot is a map of the state showing how contributions were distributed among the main presidential candidates.
